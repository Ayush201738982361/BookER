- Note: Before following the given steps make sure you have downloaded Node.js and MongoDB on your system.
To run this application on your local system , you need to clone it using the following command:
- `git clone https://github.com/Ayush201738982361/BookER.git`

After cloning the repository to your local system you need to download the dependencies , follow the below steps to install all the dependencies in the client as well as the server directory:

- `cd /client` (cd into the client folder)
- `npm install`
- `cd /server` (cd into the server folder)
- `npm install`

After the dependencies are installed in both client and server folders you need to move back to the root directory and install some other dependencies . Follow the below steps :

- `cd ..` (Command to move back to root directory)
- `npm i`

This will ensure that concurrently is installed in our root folder which will help us to run both the client and server scripts at the same time.
